I am a Senior Full Stack .NET Developer with 9+ years of experience designing, architecting, and engineering enterprise-grade applications with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and maintainability.

I specialize in:

- Building full-stack applications with .NET (C#) and React (TypeScript)
- Implementing secure authentication & authorization (OpenIddict, OAuth2, OIDC, SSO)

- Translating business requirements into scalable, long-term technical solutions

I’m passionate about building software that is clean, maintainable, cloud-ready, and built to last.
