### About Me
As an experienced .NET developer with over 9 years of professional expertise, I have a proven track record in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable web applications and services using Microsoft technologies. My main technical strengths lie in C# and .NET Core, with a deep understanding of ASP.NET MVC, Web API, and Entity Framework Core. My database expertise includes SQL Server, and I am skilled in both database design and development.

In addition to my technical background, I am well-versed in software development principles and methodologies, including:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Design Patterns (e.g., SOLID)**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **CQRS Pattern**
- **Agile Development**

I follow SOLID principles to write maintainable and scalable code and ensure code quality with unit testing (using NUnit). My experience also extends to message-based applications using MassTransit, which enables me to build robust and scalable architectures.
